# Student Record Management System (C++)

## 📌 Project Overview
This is a beginner-friendly **Student Record Management System** built using **C++**, focusing on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS)** and **File Handling**.

The program allows the user to:
- Enter details of multiple students
- Store marks for different subjects
- Calculate average marks
- Determine pass/fail status
- Save all student records permanently to a file

This project was created to strengthen the fundamentals of OOPS, STL, and file handling.

## 🛠️ Features
- Uses **classes and objects** for clean design
- Handles **multiple students dynamically**
- Stores data using **vectors**
- Uses **file handling (`ofstream`)** to persist records
- Automatically calculates:
  - Average marks
  - Pass/Fail status
- Well-structured and readable output format

---

## 📚 Concepts Used
- C++ OOPS (Class, Constructor, Encapsulation)
- STL (`vector`)
- File Handling (`ofstream`, `ios::app`)
- Conditional logic
- User input handling

---

## 📥 Input Format
- Number of students
- For each student:
  - Name
  - Roll number
  - Marks for 5 subjects

---

## 📤 Output
- Student details are saved in `data.txt`
- Output includes:
  - Name
  - Roll Number
  - Subject-wise marks
  - Average marks
  - Pass/Fail status
